# Greatly Improve Performance and FPS with no cheating with Lossless Scaling!

First things first: Go to Steam and purchase the Lossless Scaling App (it's only $6.00 USD). This is a standalone application that works with Steam and the standalone launcher. It is not only for POE2, and it will work with any game!

- It will not inject files into your POE2 folder.
- It will not violate the Terms of Service.
- It will make you smile and allow you to actually play the game and see what is going on onscreen.

## Instructions

1. Install the Lossless Scaling App.
2. Configure the app's settings according to your GPU and system requirements.
3. Launch PoE 2.
4. Alt-Tab back to the app and click the blue Scale button.
5. Immediately click back into the PoE 2 window.
6. Wait 2 seconds — the screen will flicker once, and the game will suddenly look 2x smoother.
