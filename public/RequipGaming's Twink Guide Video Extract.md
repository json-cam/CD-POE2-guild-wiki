> Bolts hit multiple enemies
>
> All items listed are budget uniques that can be found cheaply on trade
> or drop early
>
> Corrupting Fox Shade for a 3rd socket is worth the attempt - the chest
> is cheap
>
> Wanderlust's immunity to slows is huge for avoiding freeze deaths vs
> cold enemies
>
> Heavy Ammunition anoint is cheap and effective - prioritize it on your
> amulet
>
> Armor, evasion, and life are very strong in the campaign (less so in
> endgame)
>
> The campaign is generally easy - poison, ice, or ire damage types all
> work well
>
> Swap in resistance rings before boss ights (Bureer for Jamanra,
